							<h2>What I do</h2>
							<p>Over the course of my career, I've held positions of increasing authority and responsibility in a wide range of organizations of various sizes. A variety of people, both individuals and groups, have given me the opportunity to work closely on various projects and problem statements. As a result, I'm better able to handle complex problems and issues, and to do so on time and within budget.

									<h3>I'm a Researcher</h3>
									<p>I started out in the field of research and development by working at the research and development center for General Electric in New York. There, I contributed to the development of jet fighters for the Air Force by collaborating with GE Aviation on various projects. I was also able to assist GE Power in reducing their annual expenditures by contributing to the implementation of a significantly improved optimization algorithm within their design of tests. A method that I had developed while I was working on my Ph.D.</p>

									<h3>I'm a Quant and a Software Engineer</h3>
									<p>When I initially started working in the Web2 field, my first job was as a Senior Software Engineer at Flatiron Health, where I stayed for close to two years and learned everything there is to know about the operating methodology of the technology industry. I became proficient in the entirety of the software development lifecycle, as well as advanced tool use, Agile development, and working in software development teams. After that, I started working as a Quant in the Machine Learning department of an investment business based in New York City. I was responsible for the construction and maintenance of huge trading platforms here.</p>

									<h3>I'm a People Manager</h3>
									<p>I really enjoy being in charge of technological initiatives. At Advanced Blockchain, I am in charge of running and advising a sizable Web3 Research organization. I have experience managing teams consisting of as many as 15 employees. I have a strong interest in the challenges that come with managing other people and having to choose the appropriate (or sometimes just the best) actions in order to get the task done.</p>

									<h3>I'm a Blockchain Engineer & Developer</h3>
									<p>As part of my contribution to helping Web3 reach its full potential, I develop code for blockchains and design solutions for using blockchains. For instance, I was a key contributor to the development of Panoptic, which is an innovative options product that operates in the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) market: <a href="https://www.panoptic.xyz/">Learn more about this DeFi Options Protocol</a>.</p>

									<h3>I'm a Problem Solver</h3>
									<p>I decided to pursue a degree in Applied and Engineering Physics, and Computer Science, at Cornell University in order to prepare myself to tackle some of the most difficult challenges that I am confronted with. My time at Cornell taught me how to efficiently seek out knowledge, when to do so, and how to do it effectively. These practices and this frame of mind form the foundation of my typical day.</p>

									<h3>I'm a Team Player</h3>
									<p>I've always been at my best when working on a team, where we all have the same end goal of making excellent top-tier products and we all strive toward that goal together. This is when I perform at my highest level.</p>
